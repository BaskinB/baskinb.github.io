# My First Blog Post

Published on: **2024-07-27**

Welcome to my __new blog__ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build the base foundation of my eventual website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and setup my github repo and pages website.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` directory.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will be finishing the Astro tutorial, and then taking the knowledge gained from this Introductory guide to build a proper blog/landing page with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI Components.
